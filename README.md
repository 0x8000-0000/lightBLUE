# lightBLUE library

Central role for Bluetooth Smart networks.

## Scope

This library allows connecting to any Bluetooth Smart device from applications
running on Windows or Linux hosts. It implements the HCI protocol and vendor
extensions (as they are documented).

The library aids in developing automated tools for testing Bluetooth Smart
devices. The vendors have scriptable GUI interfaces such as BTool and BlueNRG
GUI - this library allows one to develop standalone tests, runnable from
Windows or Linux.
